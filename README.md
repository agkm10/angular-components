#Components in Angular 1.5 & 1.6
##Intro
This lesson will introduce components in Angular 1.5 and 1.6. We will just begin to explore components by translating what we know about directives into component syntax. 

After you get used to creating components, begin thinking about how to organize an entire app as a tree of components.

Finally, to move from Angular 1 to Angular 2 or to React, you'll need to think about moving from two-way data binding to one-way data binding.  

##Instructions
We'll build components together, so I've just given you the file structure on the master branch. That way you don't have to worry about file structure, but you still get the practice of creating the module, controllers, and components. 

If you want to look at finished examples, I'll try to publish them on the branches of this repository.
